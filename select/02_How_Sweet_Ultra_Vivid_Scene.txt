There's a tower from the dark side
There's a fire on the rise
Your trust in me
A luxury
A tool to hypnotize

And as it happens
Made assassin
Be that as it may
How sweet to serve the master
How sweet to train the slave

There's a secret gilded mirror
If you're strong enough to fail
If you wait for me
In symmetry
If you live to tell the tale

If you kick and scream
And start to dream
Of hopes of better days
How sweetly ever after
When I dig the early grave
How sweet to serve the master
And how sweet to train the slave
Sweet to train, sweet to train the slave

Well, how cold the slimy reptile
And how pure the way you kiss
How sweet this loving ignorance
'Cause loving ignorance is bliss

Now find the satin
Chain reaction
Trapped inside a maze
How sweetly ever after
I dig the early grave
How sweet to serve the master
Sweet to serve the master
For now and ever after
As befits an early grave
How sweet to serve the master
How sweet to train, sweet to train the slave.
